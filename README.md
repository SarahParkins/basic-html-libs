# Basic HTML libraries
A few very basic HTML libraries to use in websites, some with preset instalations (due to it being easier). I will put documentation below!

# Caeser cypher code but obfuscated for harder readibility.

*_0x5b5a5d* takes in two arguments: *e* and *t*. It is a function that takes in a *string e* and an *integer t* and returns a new string by iterating through the characters of e and adding t to the ASCII value of each character.
Using this is simple
------
EXAMPLE: _0x5b5a5d("Hello, world!",10) - outputs "Rovvy, gybvn!"
This will encrypt the string with a key of 10
------
_0x5b5a5d2 is very similar to _0x5b5a5d, but it subtracts t from the ASCII value of each character instead of adding it.
------
EXAMPLE: _0x5b5a5d2("Rovvy, gybvn!",10) - outputs "Hello, world!"
# Installing the Caeser cypher
Just put the code from the caeser_cypher.html into your website!
